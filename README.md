# price-lookup

This simple program helps me decide if now is a good time to buy my favorite guitar, based on my budget at the moment.
It asks me what my budget is, 
then looks up the current price of the guitar on fender's website, 
then analyzes if the current price is within or outside of my budget,
and advises me whether or not to purchase it now.

PLEASE NOTE:  This is the first python program I've created.
I am not sure if I need to be including other files here with it.
I created this code in PyCharm on December 25, 2018.
